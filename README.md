100 Day Coding Challenge-DS


Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Arrays-DS

Problem Statement: Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the hourglass sum.

ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dynamic arrays

Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0.

ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left rotation

Problem Statement:A Left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. The elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.

ðŸ“ŒDay 6: Insert Element into Sorted List

Problem Statement: An insertion operation on a sorted array shifts elements to place a new value in its correct position. Given a sorted list with an unsorted element at the end, insert it into its correct position by shifting elements as needed and print the array after each shift or insertion.

ðŸ“Œ Day 7: String Similarity

Problem Statement:For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

ðŸ“Œ Day 8: Digital Frequency

Problem Statement:Given a string,s , consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

ðŸ“Œ Day 9: Nth Term

Problem Statement:There is a series,s , where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a , b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion

ðŸ“Œ Day 10: Power Calculation

Problem Statement:Print the last two digits of S for each test case in separate lines

ðŸ“Œ Day 11: Permuting Two Arrays

Problem Statement: Given multiple queries with arrays A, B, and a value K, determine whether there exists a permutation of A' and B' such that the given condition holds. If such a permutation is possible, return "YES"; otherwise, return "NO".

ðŸ“ŒDay 12: Array Reversal

Problem Statement: Given an array, of size n, reverse it.

ðŸ“Œ Day 13 :Student Mark

Problem Statement:The array name,marks , works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words,marks contains the address where marks is stored in the memory.

ðŸ“Œ Day 14: Bitwise Operators

Problem Statement: In this task, you'll work with logical bitwise operators. Data is stored in binary form, where 1 represents true and 0 represents false. Logical operators in C compare the bits of two numbers and return either 1 (true) or 0 (false) for each bit checked.

ðŸ“ŒDay 15: Array Manipulation

Problem Statement: Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum valueÂ inÂ theÂ array.

ðŸ“Œ Day 16: Mini Max Sum

Problem Statement: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

ðŸ“Œ Day 17: Time Conversion

Problem Statement: Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

ðŸ“Œ Day 18: Grading Students

Problem Statement: Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range 0 from 100 to .

ðŸ“Œ Day 19: Diagnol Difference

Problem Statement: Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

ðŸ“Œ Day 20: Plus Minus

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal. The function should not return a value.

ðŸ“Œ Day 21: Recursive Digit Sum

Problem Staement:Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.

ðŸ“Œ Day 22: Solve Me First

Problem Staement:Complete the function solve me first to compute the sum of two integers.

ðŸ“Œ Day 23: Cat and Mouse

Problem Statement: There are two cats and a mouse positioned on a line. Given their locations x, y, and z, determine which cat reaches the mouse first. Print "Cat A" if Cat A wins, "Cat B" if Cat B wins, or "Mouse C" if both cats arrive at the same time and the mouse escapes.

ðŸ“ŒDay 24: Birthday Cake Candles

Problem Statement: You are in charge of a childâ€™s birthday cake, which has one candle for each year of their age. The child can only blow out the tallest candles. Given an array of candle heights, determine how many of them are the tallest and return the count.
