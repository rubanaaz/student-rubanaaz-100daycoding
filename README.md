100 day coding challenge


Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

ðŸ“Œ Day 1: Arrays â€“ Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

ðŸ“Œ Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

ðŸ“Œ Day 3: 2D Arrays-DS

Problem Statement: Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the hourglass sum.

ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Dynamic arrays

Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0.

ðŸ“Œ Day 5: Left rotation

Problem Statement:A Left rotation operation on a circular array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. The elements that fall off the left end reappear at the right end. Given an integer d , rotate the array that many steps to the left and return the result.

ðŸ“ŒDay 6: Insert Element into Sorted List

Problem Statement: An insertion operation on a sorted array shifts elements to place a new value in its correct position. Given a sorted list with an unsorted element at the end, insert it into its correct position by shifting elements as needed and print the array after each shift or insertion.

ðŸ“Œ Day 7: String Similarity

Problem Statement:For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings.

ðŸ“Œ Day 8: Digital Frequency

Problem Statement:Given a string,s , consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

ðŸ“Œ Day 9: Nth Term

Problem Statement:There is a series,s , where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series,a , b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion
