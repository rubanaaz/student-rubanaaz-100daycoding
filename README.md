100 day coding challenge


Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C. Each day, I will solve a problem, optimize my approach, and improve my coding skills.

📌 Day 1: Arrays – Reversing an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array A of size N, reverse the array in-place without using extra space.

📌 Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

📌 Day 3: 2D Arrays-DS

Problem Statement: Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the hourglass sum.
